It’s Solo project where I've used tect-stack like HTML, CSS, JavaScrit to make the Ebn(E-Commerce, Blog, News) with a good user-interface its Fully Responsive.It has three sections E-Commerce, Blog and News.
In E-commerce that allows Users to buy Products. It has a variety of categories, just visit the product listing page and you will see all the products, apply filters as per your need and in just a few clicks you can buy any products from the website.
In Blog and news section user can read blog and news and keep himself updated.
This project is just for educational purpose.

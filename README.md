It’s Solo project where I've used tect-stack like HTML, CSS, JavaScrit to make the Ebn(E-Commerce, Blog, News) with a good user-interface its Fully Responsive.It has three sections E-Commerce, Blog and News. In E-commerce that allows you to buy Products. It has a variety of categories, just visit the product listing page and you will see all the products, apply filters as per your need and in just a few clicks you can buy any products from the website. This project is just for educational purpose.
